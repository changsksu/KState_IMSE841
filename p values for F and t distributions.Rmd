This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# F p value cdf_value <- pf(q, df1, df2)
cdf_value <- 1- pf(3.98, 2, 11)

# t p value cdf_value <- pt(q, df1)
cdf_value <- 1- pt(4.15, 11)

# Critical F value for F test, assuming alpha=0.05
critical_F <- qf(0.95, 2, 11)
critical_F

# Critical t value for t test, assuming alpha=0.05, two sided
critical_t <- qt(0.975, 11)
critical_t
